                  </div>
                  <p class="profile-p">Before I met Inuyasha, I had lived a life that revolved around developing my spiritual abilities, I had surpassed my peers and was revered by many as a very rare priestess. I was forbidden from loving a man, for doing so would weaken my spiritual power. There came a day where I was tasked to protect a sacred crystal called the jewel of four souls. Ever since being tasked with protecting the jewel I have been relentlessly pursued by demons, of which I must slay, who wished to posess it.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="profile-p">When I first saw Inuyasha, I took pity on him, for being a half demon. He was stuck between two worlds, belonging to neither, much like myself. He continued to confront me for the Jewel, but he somehow grew fond of me, just as I did him. He assisted me in my demon slaying missions, and filled a void I thought no person could. I eventually told him that I could destroy the jewel by wishing for him to become human, and he agreed to the idea.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="profile-p">Regretfully we were both tricked by a demon who disguised himself as both of us. In the guise of Inuyasha the demon told me to meet Inuyasha earlier than planned. I went as I was asked, and was fatally wounded by the imposter thinking it was Inuyasha. In my vengeance I sealed Inuyasha to the Tree of ages into an eternal slumber. I had my body burned with the jewel hoping to take it into my next incarnation in another era, protecting the ones I loved from the dangers of the jewel.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p class="profile-p">I had been dead for 50 years, when somehow my reincarnation,Kagome, from modern day Japan found her way into my time in the feudal era by way of the Bone Eater's well with the jewel inside of her. Kagome woke Inuyasha from his slumber in an attempt to be saved from a demon trying to obtain the jewel. Nevertheless she got the jewel back, and Inuyasha was keen on obtaining it. However the jewel was shattered and dispersed across the land by the an arrow shot by Kagome. A demon witch named Urusue wanted to obtain the shards, so she dug up my remains and resurected a hollow version of me in her demon kiln. She extracted Kagome's soul and I was revived, but Kagome was strong and recalled most of her soul back. I escaped with what little  of my soul I had left in me.</p>

                  <p class="profile-p">I still believed I was truly betrayed by Inuyasha. It became a mission of mine to take him back to hell with me. I met a demon named Naraku who wished to help me with my mission.</p>

                  <p class="profile-p">I eventually realized that the demon helping me was in fact responsible for the misunderstanding between Inuyasha and I. It became my mission to slay this demon, and to purify the sacred jewel. Meanwhile I had grown bitter and envious toward Kagome's budding relationship with Inuyasha.</p>

I still had my own strategies, and schemes, but there was a reason for all of them. I had come to accept my existence as one of the living dead, and sought to do what I could to make the world better and defeat Naraku while I still existed.</p>

                  <p class="profile-p">After many battles my vessel had succumbed to poison, and grown very frail. In a battle with Naraku, the evil demon who started this whole ordeal, I was fatally wounded for the final time. Inuyasha and his friends fought bravely, causing Naraku to flee so that he could recover. When the battle was over, Inuyasha carried me to a hillside where he sat holding me in his arms, as the sun set. He wept as we said our final words to one another.  After our last kiss I smiled at my beloved Inuyasha one last time. It was then that I passed, dissipating into ether.</p>
